Long ago, a peaceful, mountainside village was assailed by cruel demons.

Too small to defend itself, and too remote to call for help, there was little hope for salvation.

------next scene----------

One day, a lone traveller arrived at the village, and offered to save them from their plight.

The traveller sealed the demons inside papercrafts, folding their hatred and grief into beauty.

The villagers hailed the traveller as a hero, and promised to remember her deeds every 100 years with a festival.

However, the hero knew that the demons' malice would stir during the celebrations, and they would seek revenge.

Thus, she made a promise.

"I vow, when the spirits of evil rise to disturb your peace, my descendants will return to protect you forevermore."
